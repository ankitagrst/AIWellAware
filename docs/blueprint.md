# **App Name**: WellAware AI

## Core Features:

- Ritual Generator: Personalized wellness ritual generation, combining Sanatan, Ayurveda, and Vedic traditions. The tool adapts suggestions based on user inputs, historical practices, and scientific insights.
- Chatbot UI: Interactive chatbot interface for seamless communication and guidance. The AI will use its tool for reasoning.

- Resource Library: Wellness resources library with articles, videos, and guided meditations related to Sanatan, Ayurveda, and Vedic traditions.
- Community Forum: Community forum for users to connect, share experiences, and support each other on their wellness journeys.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep saffron (#FF9933), evokes wisdom, spirituality, and sacrifice, resonating with traditional roots. Not a literal reference to a wellness app being 'green'.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), close in hue to the primary but greatly desaturated, to ensure a soft and tranquil feel with a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFB366), analogous to the primary with enough difference in saturation to offer visual contrast and signal interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. This blends a traditional, literary feel with a contemporary tech sensibility.
- Line-based icons representing Sanatan, Ayurvedic, and Vedic symbols.
- Clean, minimalist design with a focus on readability and easy navigation.
- Subtle animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback.
